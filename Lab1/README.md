# CST352Lab1
Includes source files and test file

Lab 1 for OIT Operating Systems class. This lab mimics the functionality of Linux pipes "|".

Scored 80/100 points on the lab. Feedback:
-  It appears like you postfilter removes lines that did not have the filter character. It should have kept them.
-  based on stderr, your prefilter always finishes before your postfilter starts.
-  Indentation is supposed to be set to 3 or 4 characters, not 2.
-  In process.c, main() should be broken into smaller functions.
